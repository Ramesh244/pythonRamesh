1.Given a string S and a character C (as string of length 1), return a string with the characters surrounding any occurrence of C reversed. 
For example, if S is "Hello beautiful world" and C is a space, return "Hellb oeautifuw lorld" 
take input as a string with many words,seperated by spaces,swap the last character of 1st word and 1st character of the next word.
hint: split the string into a list and loop the list and write if condition for whitespaces where occured,
if condition is True then swap the last character of the word
with 1st character of the next word. 
ex1: input=" ravi teja kumar"
    output="ravt iejk aumar"
ex2: input="happy new year"
    output:happn yey wear"

2.given integer n as input, write a program to display the sum of the first n terms in harmonic series.

input:
      The first line of input is an integer N
output:
      print the sum rounded upto 2 decimal places
explanation:
      for n=5
      the sum of first 5 terms in harmonic series 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5
      so, the output should be 2.28
sample input1: 5

4.given alist of integers write a program to print the count of all possible unique combinations of numbers whose sum is equal to k
explanation:for example if given list of integers and k are 
2 4 6 1 3
6
all possible combinations of the given list are
(6,)(2,)(4,)(1,)(  3,)
(2,4)(1,2)(3,4)(4,6)(1,4)(2,3)(2,6)(3,6)(1,6)(1,3)
(3,4,6)(2,3,6)(1,2,6)(1,2,3)(1,4,6)(1,3,4)(2,3,4)(1,3,6)
(2,3,4,6)(1,2,3,4)(1,2,4,6)(1,2,3,6)(1,3,4,6)
out of all the above combinations  the unique combinations with the sum equal to 6 are
6
2 4
2 1 3
so the output should be the count of unique combinations which is 3
for example if the given list of integers and k are
-1 4 5 6 7 8 2 4 5 2 3 8
7
The unique combinations with the sum equal to 7 are
7
-1 8
3 4
2 5
-1 3 5
-1 4 4
-1 2 6
2 2 3
-1 2 2 4
so the output should be the count of unique combinations which is 9
input:  2 4 6 1 3
         6
output:  3
Note: Dont use permutations and combiations method

10.Univariate quadratic polynomials are the most common polynomials. 
Polynomials with only one unknown number and the highest degree of 2 are called univariate quadratic polynomials.
 Its standard form is ax^2+bx+c
Please complete the code in solution.py to realize the function of equation.
The equation function receives three parameters a, b, and c as the quadratic term, the primary term, and the constant term of the standard form of a bivariate quadratic polynomial. 
Please use the lambda function to pass in an unknown number x for the equation function and take this lambda function as the return value of the equation function. 
Find the result of the univariate quadratic polynomial ax^2+bx+c

17.Polynomial

Given polynomial, write a program that prints
polynomial in Cix^Pi + Ci-1x^Pi-1 + ... + C1x + CO
format.

Input
The first line contains a single integer N.
Next N lines contain two integers Pi, Ci
separated with space, where Pi denotes power
and Ci denotes coefficient of Pi.

Output
Print the polynomial in the format Cix^Pi + Ci-
1x^Pi-1 + ... + C1x + CO, where Pi's are powers
in decreasing order, Ci is coefficient, and CO is
constant. There will be space before and after
the plus or minus sign.
If the coefficient is zero, then don't print the
term.
If the term with the highest degree is negative,
in decreasing order, Ci is coefficient, and CO is
constant. There will be space before and after
the plus or minus sign.
If the coefficient is zero, then don't print the
term.
If the term with the highest degree is negative,
the term should represent -Cix^Pi.
For the term where power is 1, represent it as
C1x instead of C1x^1.
If the polynomial degree is zero and the
constant term is also zero, then print 0 to
represent the polynomial.
For term Cix^Pi, if the coefficient of the term Ci
is 1, print x^Pi instead of 1x^Pi.

Explanation
If N = 4
For power 0, the coefficient is 5
For power 1, the coefficient is 0
For power 2, the coefficient is 10
For power 3, the coefficient is 6.
Then polynomial represents "6x^3 + 10x^2 + 5"
For power 2, the coefficient is 10
For power 3, the coefficient is 6.
Then polynomial represents "6x^3 + 10x^2 + 5"
Constraints
N <= 100
0 <= Pi < 1000
-1000 <= Ci <= 1000

Sample Input

21.''' Write a  Python Program using Multithreading ,
Consider a couple who is having a Joint account and both are having their ATM cards.
They come to different ATMs and try to withdraw some amount at the same time.
Letâ€™s say the total balance in the account is 500 and Wife tries to withdraw 450
and the husband tries to withdraw 100. When they swipe the card for withdrawing money,
the balance shown will be 500. Two threads will be created for the transaction,
out of which only one thread should be successful and the other should fail.
If both the threads get successful then its a loss to the bank.
So, the threads should be in synchronization so that one fails and the other wins.'''
